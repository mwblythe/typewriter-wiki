Welcome to the typewriter life wiki!  Want to [contribute](contribute)?

Typewriters have been around for over a century and may seem obsolete in the computer age. We know better! Typewriters are beautiful single purpose tools that let us focus on writing without disctraction or the worry of privacy violation. With manual machines, electricity isn't even a limitation. Write anywhere you wish, for as long as you wish, provided your paper and ink hold out. More and more people are (re)discovering this freedom, and we hope you'll join us if you haven't already.
