<!-- TITLE: Type-Ins -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: type with others -->

A "type-in" is an in-person event where people get together to type, socialize, and share about typewriters. Commonly hosted by a business or organization, it can be a fun way to meet other enthusiasts, try out a variety of typewriters, or perhaps share a few of your own machines. We haven't found a centralized directory or calendar of them yet, but online typewriter [communities](/useful-links/resources#communities) often publicize them.

A type-in calendar may be on the horizon here at Typewriter Life, but not yet.

**Fun Fact:** An outdoor type-in is sometimes called a "type-out".
