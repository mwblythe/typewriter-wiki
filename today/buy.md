<!-- TITLE: Buying a Typewriter -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: carefully find what you want -->

Michael's craft store is selling a [craptastic](http://xoverit.blogspot.com/2016/09/keeping-memories-with-typewriter.html) Chinese typewriter called "We R Memory Keepers". **You do not want these.**

What do you want?
