<!-- TITLE: Repair Shops -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A dying breed? -->

Like all machines, typewriters will eventually need to be repaired. Maybe you bought a new (to you) typewriter that needs some help. Perhaps your favorite has been working like a champ, but now skips periodically. Who you gonna call? Good question.

You can invest the time to learn how to repair it yourself, but maybe that's just not for you. Time to find a professional! Unfortunately, there are not nearly as many repair shops as there used to be. They do still exist, though!

Richard Polt maintains the most current [list of shops](http://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/tw-repair.html). Perhaps there is one near you.

If not, find a [community](/useful-links/resources#communities) or start [learning](/maintenance/basic).
