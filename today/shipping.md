* Secure the carriage if possible, by activating the carriage lock or moving margins to the middle
* Put the machine in caps/shift lock position
* Stuff crumpled paper into the type basket, where the type bars are
* Wrap the machine (or soft-sided case) with at least two layers of bubble wrap
* Place it into an inner box that fits as closely as possible, filling void space as well as possible
* Choose an outer box at least 2" larger in every dimension
* Place inner box into outer box, filling void space with crumpled paper or packing peanuts

Insure the shipment for full purchase price, because carriers can still damage typewriters even with careful packing.
