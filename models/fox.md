The History of the Fox Typewriter Company

-------- The Fox Typewriter Company --------

“The greatest thing about Mr. Fox is his unwavering hope, faith, courage, and cheerfulness in the face of the most trying circumstances. No difficulty daunts him, and he always finds a way out.” 
Fox Factory Employee, ca. 1908

	By the end of 1923, after years of strenuous legal battles and lackluster sales, the once renowned Fox Typewriter Company was no more. The landmark factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was foreclosed and its assets were seized and liquidated to appease stockholders. But before such an end could occur, a prosperous beginning had allowed the company to survive through the incredibly competitive early years of the struggling typewriter market. Standing firmly at the helm of that success was none other than William Ross Fox. 
	In 1853, in the small city of Middletown, Connecticut, William Ross Fox was born. His life was quickly interrupted at the age of 9 by the death of his father, and the enlistment of his two older brothers into the Union Army. His unexpected experience as the only male left at the Fox household would incidentally start him down the road of success as he began peddling root-beer at a local general store where he would soon become the primary manager.
	Despite his experiences as a manager and salesman, Fox found considerable interest in the field of machinery and between the ages of 16 and 21 worked in the areas of tool making, machine tending, and steam engineering. By the age of 21, he desired to enter into the Technological Institute of Worcester, Massachusetts, but was at that time unable to do so due to a lack of knowledge in required topics such as algebra and grammar. Determined to gain admittance, he utilized his free time in the evenings to study those necessary topics, and was successful in passing the entrance examinations. His educational prospects were cut short when he contracted typhoid-pneumonia, which he was barely able to survive. After recuperating, he gained employment at the American Thread Co. in Willmette, Connecticut.
	While he was in Willmette, he stumbled onto the path which would lead him into direct manufacturing. He had married, and helped his wife create wooden frames for mottos. In doing so he was forced to use a poorly made miter box, which he despised. Utilizing his mechanical knowledge and ambition, he set about creating a superior design, eventually designing the Fox trimmer which in later years would gain incredible success within the market. Over the course of two years, he perfected the trimmer, invented a rotary steam pump, and designed a steam chime whistle.
	In the fall of 1879, Fox chose to head west and settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan, gaining employment at the factory of Perkins and Co. as a draftsman and pattern maker. At the same time, he continued to make arrangements with businesses back in the East to produce his trimmer and sell it on a royalty basis. After two years at Perkins and Co., Fox gained employment at the Michigan Tool Works, and soon after at the Farmers Roller Mill Co., gaining valuable knowledge regarding machinery along the way. While at the Farmers Roller Mill Co., he was able to make improvements to roller-mill machinery that had been beyond the abilities of some of the largest manufacturers in the field. He was also able to attain the use of water power and machinery in the factory, and utilized such to produce a few of his trimmers which he subsequently sold via correspondence.
	He soon went to work at the Berkey and Gay Furniture Company, where he invented the Fox furniture caster. In 1886 he sold his half-interest in the caster to the company, getting in exchange 18 month’s rent of a few square feet of floor space where he began working actively on the manufacture of the Fox trimmer. At this point, he had capital of $1,545.48, of which $800 was in cash and second hand tools.  Thus was born the Fox Machine Company.

 

	The venture quickly grew, with Fox himself superintending the work, designing the machinery, making new tools, selling the product, maintaining the books, attending to the correspondence, creating the advertisements, and planning the extensions. Within two years, the company was successful enough to afford the creation of a new two-story brick building built specifically for it, with an additional two stories added shortly thereafter. With new and expansive quarters, business grew at an accelerated rate. In 1892 the enterprise was finally incorporated, having on the books tangible assets of $75,000 and capital of $150,000 [29].
	In 1893, when the bicycle market began to unfold due to better general designs, Fox began to manufacture high grade wheels (eventually also producing a limited number of complete bicycles). Believing the initial output to be unsatisfactory, Fox worked on improving the machines which produced the wheels, and was successful at that endeavor to the point that other bicycle makers demanded Fox’s machinery designs to make their own parts. However, when the bicycle craze of the 1890’s ended, Fox was left with very specific and specialized machinery for fine work and nothing to use it for. Ever the entrepreneur, Fox set his gaze upon the relatively new typewriter market, deciding that his equipment could very well manufacture such a machine.
	In 1896, Glenn J. Barrett was hired to help design the machine. Barrett brought with him a functional prototype machine which he had already been working upon, greatly helping the effort. Fox himself spent an astounding amount of time studying and researching the field of typewriter design, covering almost every patent that had ever been made regarding typewriters, and conducting a long course of experiments. After months of hard work and dedication, the first viable Fox Typewriter was produced. After spending time improving the design as needed, the Fox Model 1 was introduced to the market in 1898, soon followed by the Fox Model 2. Shortly afterwards, continued improvement and innovations saw the Model 3 and Model 4 entering the market, the direct successors of the Model 1 and Model 2 accordingly. 
	By February of 1902, Mr. Fox was working to secure capital and stock subscriptions to provide for expanded facilities for the typewriter enterprise [18]. On April 30th, 1902, the Fox Typewriter Company was officially formed, succeeding the business of the Fox Machine Company, and taking possession of its assets and workforce. It was organized with initial capital of $1,000,000 [29], and had a corporate board consisting of Mr. William Fox as president, C. H. Hollister as treasurer, George Clapperton as secretary, and James R. Wylie and C. W. Post [33]. Though limited production of miter trimmers and other machinery would continue, the majority of the enterprise was dedicated to the production of typewriters. Over the course of 1903, roughly $50,000 was spent on enlarging and improving the facilities.
	After having established the success of the blind machines, and with the market successes of the Oliver, Underwood, and other visible designs, Fox set about designing his own visible machine. With the aid of a small group of talented individuals, which included his son W. H. Fox, a working prototype was developed by hand within twelve months, at a cost of $1,000. Once the prototype was improved as needed, it was subjected to a merciless and thorough trial, which it completed handedly.
	Within twelve months of the first prototype being perfected, and the launch of the Model 23 in 1906, over two thousand special tools were made for building it, and over $80,000 worth of finished typewriters were sold. The reputation Fox had created for quality helped ensure the immediate success of the visible machines. The Model 24 quickly followed the Model 23 to market, as improvements were continuously made.
	As his company continued to grow and thrive, Fox still took the time to conduct interviews, write and respond to correspondence, plan promotions, work on machine designs, attend to legal matters, work on typewriter improvements, promote the business, and conduct general management within the company. Fox made it the company’s continuing goal to improve the quality of the product, regardless of cost, and to reduce manufacturing costs without detriment to quality. Despite the paradoxical nature of this idea, it was achieved in innovative ways; by having employees scrutinize every last screw and spring, quality of every machine was achieved as no inferior product was allowed. At the same time, the implementation of a special cost system of accounting allowed the cost of any action or production to be reported to a manager within two hours, allowing for any issues to be immediately dealt with [11].
	Despite the continuing advances occurring at the Fox factory, 1913 and 1914 would be the apex for the company in regards to employment levels and machine production. As the company had grown, it had come to rely heavily upon foreign trade to support its business, and had endeavored to establish dealers in Europe and South America. Fatefully, in 1914, the world plunged into war, and as the fragile peace of Europe shattered so too did the level of typewriter exports from the United States. With its foreign business crippled, and the world economy slowing down due to the war, Fox quickly found itself unable to sell all the machines it was producing and by August of 1914, the factory was formally closed. Prior to the wars outbreak, plans had been in place to separate the machine company from the typewriter company and expand them both, with Mr. Fox still working directly with both companies. Due to the closure of the typewriter factory, however, William R. Fox decided to leave the typewriter enterprise entirely, and took a majority of the skilled workforce with him as he split the machine company off [19].
Accordingly, the typewriter enterprise was reorganized under new management. In July of 1915, a shareholder meeting occurred in which it was decided to create a new enterprise from the ashes of the old. At the time, there were liabilities of $46,000 on the books [32], which were easily surpassed by the newly paid-in capital of $100,000 of the $150,000 authorized [4]. Mr. Fred Chichester was elected President, Mr. Howard Baxter was elected Vice-President, Mr. Earl Stokes was elected Treasurer and General Manager, Mr. Irving Franks was elected Secretary and Sales Manager. Alongside Mr. W. Shaw, these officers constituted the new directorate of the company.

  
Mr. Fred Chichester

With new management in place, it was decided the company would enter into the portable typewriter market, and so they looked to the genius of Henry P. Nordmark to create a new typewriter design. Originally hired by the company in 1912 as a toolmaker, Mr. Nordmark had quickly risen to the positions of works superintendent, chief engineer, and designer [42]. The result of his effort was the Fox Portable typewriter, which folded its carriage behind the main body when not in use and was in many ways comparable to the other major portable on the market at the time, the Corona 3 portable typewriter. This new portable was launched in 1917, after a vigorous advertising campaign.
 
Mr. Henry P. Nordmark

	By the end of 1918, when the First World War finally came to an end, the Fox Typewriter Company was still trying to build itself back up to what it had once been. However, a lack of innovation regarding their desktop models had left them lagging behind their competition, and the factory was still working to ramp up production of the new portable. Also plaguing the entire industry at the time was a severe shortage of materials such as steel, due to the war effort and the steel strike which took place in late 1919. The company was on an uphill climb, but the progress was slow going, and it would take time to truly become financially secure again. Time, however, was not on the company’s side as on July 16th of 1919, the Corona Typewriter Company filed a Bill of Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. A subpoena was issued that very day and was served to the Fox Typewriter Company, requiring it to answer within twenty days. The primary charges were for patent infringement concerning the folding carriage, the escapement mechanism, the ribbon vibrator mechanism, and for the sale of typewriting machines that copied the form and appearance of Corona’s machine, namely relating to the frame surrounding the keyboard.
	Though the company continued to produce its portable machine, in June and July of 1920 the court session between Fox and Corona played out. Corona attempted to persuade the court that the patents it held, though in some cases rather vague to the ideas protected, were infringed by Fox, who in turn attempted to prove that said patents were either defunct based on being so vague as to cover more than a reasonable amount of possible invention, or were at the least expired based upon original publications. The final hearing took place on August the 2nd and 3rd of 1920, with the final decision rendered on August 27th. The ruling found Fox as having infringed 6 of the 8 patents brought forth by Corona, and ordered an accounting of the profits derived from infringing machines. The court also ordered an injunction against Fox’s manufacturing of offending machines.
	Fox would not be so easily beaten, and on December 9th of that same year made an appeal to the court to reopen the case. The appeal was granted, and in the subsequent court case, many prior infringements were overturned; the Petermann patent, No. 1064372, was held invalid for want of invention. The Hazen patent, No. 1121094, was held lacking in invention. Hazen patent No. 1121097 was held valid for certain claims, and invalid for others, and overall held infringed for 3 specific claims. The Rose reissue patent No. 13935 was held as insufficient as basis for an injunction against a device not infringing the original patent, and was separately held invalid as double patenting. The Latta reissue patent, No. 14495, was held valid and infringed. The Petermann reissue patent, No. 1459, was held lacking in invention for certain claims, and for others rendered invalid by inclusion of common element [3].

 
Mr. Walter A. Papworth

The damage had already been done, however, and an injured revenue stream coupled with a high cost of manufacture crippled the company. In May of 1921, Walter A. Papworth was appointed as Receiver and General Manager to comply with creditor demands [2]. An attempt by W. Bennington to purchase the enterprise for the production of the Bennington typewriter was unsuccessful, and in July of 1922 the company lowered its capitalization from $450,000 to just $45,000. At the same time, due to the company defaulting on interest payments, the creditors of the company began to call for action. The First National Bank of Chicago filed against the company on a $100,000 mortgage, followed quickly by the Shaw Association which foreclosed on another $100,000 mortgage due to its ownership of a large amount of bonds [1].
	Ultimately there was little that the Fox Typewriter Company could do against such overwhelming demands as its factory remained at a near standstill. An attempt was made by William Bennington [21] to secure the factory and assets for the amount of $300,000, but this deal fell through [22]. On September the 15th, 1923, the District Court ordered the sale by receiver of all assets and property [20]. By the end of 1922, the proud makers of the Fox typewriter were but a memory in the business world after 25 years, though their wonderful machines still lived on as beautiful reminders of the grand enterprise which was proudly located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

--------- The Fox Factory ---------
 
	Built upon the edge of the Grand River and located on North Front Street, Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Fox factory first housed the Fox Machine Company, and then later the Fox Typewriter Company.  Originally built in 1888, the factory stood two stories tall. Prior to 1890, another two stories were added. The Fox general offices were contained in the same building, and it was from this address that all business was conducted.
	Tracing the construction of a machine through the factory, one would start in the drafting room, where initial concepts and designs would have been drawn out and engineered. These concepts would then proceed to the model room, where a perfected model would be created and then sent off to one of three specific branches of manufacture. The first of these was the foundry, utilized for parts which needed to be casted. The second was the automatic screw machine department, which created all screws used in the production of a machine. The third and final manufacturing branch was the punch-press department, which was utilized for all parts not made in the other two branches.
	Starting in the foundry, iron castings were made from brass patterns. They were then sent to the rattling room where they would then be cleaned and smoothened up before being sent to the enameling room where they received their first coat of enamel so as to prevent any immediate rust forming. The castings would then be sent to the milling machine department where holes were drilled and tapped. The side plates of the frame alone went through thirty-five different operations, between each of which there was an inspection via gauges accurate to the thousandth of an inch, with any piece not meeting strict requirements thrown out. Once milling was completed, the pieces were sent back to the enameling room where they received two more coats of enamel, were polished, decorated with pinstriping and decals, and finally varnished. The machine frame was at that point ready for assembling and was sent to the assembling department. 
 
The Buffer Room

	In the screw department, a line of screw producing machines stood, being fed steel rods of the necessary gauge and turning out finished screws and bolts. Any one machine was capable of turning out anywhere from ten to twenty thousand pieces per day, without error and with constant uniformity. All parts processed through the screw department were ultimately given a nickel plating or a dull finish by being burnt in oil.
	In the punch-press department, the most advanced machinery was utilized, with all work being done by young men. Machine presses utilized special master-dies which could cost anywhere between $50 to $250. By utilizing these punch-presses, all pieces produced were in perfect conformity and perfectly interchangeable. Following production in the punch-press department, parts were then either nickel plated, or given a special finish to prevent rust. If they were to be nickel plated, they were sent to the nickeling department.
	In the nickeling department, a part would first be polished on a buffering machine before being submerged in a bath and cleansed by an electrical process. After this, it would be given a heavy coat of copper and checked over for any rust, before given another coat of copper. On top of the copper base, a coat of nickel not less than three quarters of a thousandth of an inch thick was applied. The part was then polished again and sent to the stock department in a finished condition.
	In the drop-forging department, the typebars used in Fox typewriters began life. Made from a specially selected grade of steel, the typebars went through four operations before leaving the drop-forging department in a still rough state. The typebars were then drilled and reamed for the type shank and pivot bearing before being polished and nickeled. Following this, the pivot was created from tempered high grade drill rod. These pivots were between 7/16 and 9/16 of an inch wide and were tapered on a special machine revolving at a speed of 12,000 revolutions per minute. The typebar with its pivot attached was then forced into the typebar hanger by a special patented process.
	The manufacture of type began with cold rolled steel being stamped out by a punch press, with a total of seven operations being conducted before it was finished. The creation of the matrices from which the typefaces were made was an involved process, starting with the drawing of a character on paper fifty times the size of the type. From this paper pattern a brass pattern was made, which was then inserted in a matrix cutting machine where the two characters desired on the particular type to be made were cut. The impressions were cut in exact proportions onto a matrix, which is a piece of tool steel about one inch square. The matrix was then hardened and placed in a type rolling machine. Also placed into this machine were small pieces of steel which would eventually be the type. The matrix type was then rolled against the small piece of steel with two tons of pressure, creating the perfectly cut letter. Prior to this process, the creation of a matrix was done by highly skilled mechanists who were quite hard to find as such expertise took a lifetime of study and so few men in America had the necessary skill.
	All parts when finished were sent to the stock department, and were then distributed to where they were needed. The assembling department started on one side of the factory, and ended on the other. Beginning with the frame, the keylevers were first inserted, then the ribbon feed mechanism, the typebars, the escapement, the carriage, and the platen. The machines would then be sent to the aligning department. 
In the aligning department, which was a separate room from the manufacturing departments and as far removed from noise and intrusion, the most skilled workmen employed attached the type to the typebars and made any necessary adjustments to the machine. An inspector then worked the machine, rigorously testing it for any issue or error.
The finished machine would then be handed over to the packing and shipping department, and from there it was sent out to customers, dealers, or wholesalers, ready to be used as soon as it exited its crate [10].

 

--------- Individuals of Importance ---------
William Ross Fox
	Born in the small city of Middletown, Connecticut in 1853, William R. Fox was the man behind the Fox Machine Company and the Fox Typewriter Company. With an unshakable interest in engineering and design, he began his business career with the advent of the Fox Miter Trimmer, before starting his machine company so as to produce industrial devices. After introducing the Fox typewriter to the market in 1898, he dedicated most of his time and skill to the typewriter enterprise until 1915, when he split the machine company off and moved it to Jackson, Michigan. There, he continued to actively lead the Fox Machine Company until a fall from a catwalk at the factory led to his death on July the 20th, 1934. See pages 7 - 11 for more information on his early life.

Fred Ives Chichester
After William Fox split the machine company off of the typewriter enterprise, the Fox Typewriter Company was reorganized with new capital and management. Elected as the new President was Fred I. Chichester, a man of well-regarded ability. Born in Otsego, Minnesota in 1866, he quickly dedicated himself to the field of business. For 20 years he was the president of the First National Bank of Allegan, Michigan, and was a Director of the First State Bank of Petoskey, Michigan. He was also a Director at Blood Bros. Machine Co. of Allegan, as well as the director and vice-president of Allegan Steel Process Company. His experience in the financial world helped him rebuild the Fox Typewriter Company as president. While he primarily managed the affairs of the company, he also dedicated a large portion of his time to the creation and successful launch of the portable machine. Mr. Chichester died December 21st, 1943 [43].
Henry Peter Nordmark
Born in Fredrikstad, Norway on July 15th of 1888, Henry P. Nordmark first gained an education in mechanics before moving to the United States. In 1912, he was hired by the Fox Typewriter Company as a toolmaker, but quickly rose to the positions of works superintendent, chief engineer, and designer. Though he helped the firm develop improvements for its machines, he is most well-known for his work in developing the Fox portable typewriter. Mr. Nordmark died in Grand Rapids in April of 1968 [42].

Irving Franks
Mr. Irving Franks started his career at the Fox Typewriter Company in 1905, first hired as a branch office manager before later becoming the advertising and sales manager for the company. Elected to the board of directors after the reorganization in 1915, Mr. Franks was the secretary, sales, and advertising manager until 1917, when he departed the company and sold all of his financial interest in the enterprise [44].

Earl Stokoe
One of the longest serving employees of the Fox enterprise, Earl Stokoe was hired by the machine company in 1891. Over the course of his employment, he was elected Secretary and Treasurer a multitude of times, working closely with William Fox. In 1915, Mr. Stokoe stayed with the typewriter company, and was elected to the position of General Manager after the reorganization. He remained with the company up until its demise [44].


---- The Importance of Foreign Business ----
While nearly all typewriter enterprises relied upon foreign sales to some extent, Fox is notable for its incredible success around the globe. Fox sold large quantities of machines in Germany, Russia, South Africa, Australia, India, China, Mexico, and South America just to name a few, and so it is no surprise that when the first World War broke out, the company was hit hard. Listed below is known export data regarding the Fox Typewriter Company. Note that some later orders, specifically those relating to the portable models, were likely unfulfilled due to court litigation and the demise of the company

Known Orders:
Year		Destination		# of Machines		Model		
1902	Oct.	Germany [23]		80			Standard
1917	July	Russia			500			Standard
1917	Nov.	Russia			500			Model 28
1917	Nov.	South America		10,000			Standard
1917	Nov.	South America		6,000			Portable 1
Other Orders:
	In early January of 1902, a contract was negotiated for $1,000,000 worth of machines to be exported to Europe [34].
In September 1903, a contract was negotiated with a general American dealer in Russia for the exportation of $1,250,000 worth of machines over the next three years [24].
	In December of 1908, a special Fox Model 24 was completed for the lieutenant governor of Burma. It was finished with ivory white enamel, with all metal parts nickeled, and ornamented in red and gold. The keys were made of white celluloid, the spacebar made of white holly wood, and the scales were finished in nickel and given red markings. The cover was also finished in white enamel, and both the cover and machine were given additional decaling depicting the imperial arms of the British Empire [25].
	In February of 1912, an order was placed for two machines to be used in the household of Austria’s Archduke Francis Ferdinand. These machines were given an additional decal depicting the imperial coat of arms [26].


















------- Employment at the Fox Factory -------
	In 1905, roughly 6,232 men were employed at 62 separate factories in the typewriter industry in the United States, producing roughly 750 machines a day [10]. One of those factories was producing the Fox typewriter, and in 1905 it employed roughly 250 men, representing about 4% of the total industry. At the same time, about 28 women were employed in the general offices of the factory.
	The Fox factory experienced fluctuations in general employment based upon a multitude of factors, such as economic changes, general production levels, market demand, and more. Detailed on the following page is a list of known employment numbers as given in the Michigan Bureau of Labor Statistics Annual Reports for years between 1898 and 1922 [17].
	It should be noted that until the formal creation of the Fox Typewriter Company in 1902, the employment numbers known prior to that date represent the Fox Machine Company in its entirety. Also notable due to the typewriter concern obtaining the assets of the old machine company at that date, is that the employment levels after 1902 contain those workers that worked primarily on the machine company’s products (such as miter trimmers), though the number of employees involved in this would have been small.









Year		Male		Female		Total

*In 1915, William Fox split the Fox Machine Company away from the Fox Typewriter Company. In doing so, 155 male and 4 female workers went with the machine company or were laid off, and the remaining 10 male and 11 female employees stayed with the typewriter enterprise.


------- Typewriter Prices and Profits -------
	The Fox Typewriter was commonly advertised as a $100 machine, and the quality of its build ensures that such a price was well deserved. However, price points would often be negotiated in favor of the purchaser or wholesaler. Below, a list of known price points for certain customers is detailed;


Customer and Machine:					Price		
Fox Catalog, ca. 1900[8]
Fox Model 4 (New)				$105
	Fox Model 4 (New) With Tabulator		$125
The State of Michigan, 1909[9]
	Fox Model 24 (New)				$80.80
	Fox Model 25 (New)				$80.80
The State of Illinois, 1907[15]
	Fox Typewriter (New)				$90
The State of North Dakota, 1904[35]
	Fox Typewriter (New)				$90
The State of Indiana, 1904 [37]
	Desktop (New)				$90
Wholesaler, 1903 [16]
	Fox Model 3 (New)				$75



	Just as the actual price paid by various customers fluctuated, so too did the general profit margins per machine. Detailed below are the profits derived from the sales of Fox visible machines around the launch date [6].
For the period of:					Profit per machine
June, 1906:						$0.625			
July 1906 to June 1907:					$11.85
July 1907 to June 1908:					$5.70
	Additionally it is notable that the single-stop tabulator cost $0.89 to build, and the ten-stop tabulator (of which only 530 were produced by 1911) cost $5.17. 












 
Section 2:
The Fox Typewriters

Over the course of 25 years, the Fox Typewriter Company produced 20 different primary models, 17 of which were desktop office machines, and 3 of which were portable machines. There are also a few rebranded machines and name variants that are known to collectors.
Though improvements and adjustments to the design were made, the very first Fox understroke is not entirely all that different from the very last Fox understroke, nor is the first Fox visible very different from the last. 
The latest known desktop serial number is slightly beyond 125,000, though there is some doubt as to whether or not all numbers up to that point were utilized. Of the portable models, slightly more than 13,000 were produced.
Listed on the following pages, each model manufactured by the Fox Typewriter Company is detailed. Some information is found duplicated on different pages, so that each model’s description stands on its own and does not require direct reference to a prior or later model.
It will be noted that Fox offered a choice of type-styles, different font sizes, and a great multitude of special characters, as well as offering a special stencil-cutting type.

	Fox offered the following type styles: [8]

Medium Roman with 8 spaces to the inch
Large Italic with 8 spaces to the inch
Pica with 10 spaces to the inch
Small Italic with 10 spaces to the inch
Elite with 12 spaces to the inch

Produced from 1898 until roughly 1902

Introduced into the market in 1898, the Fox Model 1 is the product of the work of Mr. Glenn J. Barrett and Mr. William R. Fox, with development based off of Barrett’s prototype having started in 1896. The machine boasts a platen, rather than carriage, shift. Due to the nature of the typebar hangers, which allow for instant adjustment when necessary, Fox machines are easily kept in perfect, permanent alignment.
The Fox Model 1 has a keyboard consisting of 38 keys with a single shift key, producing 76 characters.

Produced from 1899 until roughly 1902

The Fox Model 2 quickly followed the Model 1 to market, and has a keyboard consisting of 44 keys, producing 88 characters. The Model 2 is fundamentally the same as the Model 1, save for the larger keyboard and a few improvements to the general mechanics. It was the primary export machine, as the extra keys were intended for foreign language characters. Domestic machines utilized extra fractions and symbols. Also notable is the inclusion of a cover for the front typebar hangers [8].
The Fox Model 2 was produced alongside the Model 1, and for a short while the Model 3 and Model 4 as well. It can be easily distinguished by its quarter-round front bar with a leaf-like pattern around the Fox head logo.








--------- Fox Model 3 ---------

--------- Fox Model 3 ---------

Introduced 1901
Produced from 1901 to 1906
Retail Price New: $100 [8]
Net Weight: 26 ¼ lbs [8]

The Fox Model 3 was introduced in 1901, and is the spiritual successor to the Model 1. It has a keyboard consisting of 39 keys, printing 78 characters, and takes paper 9 inches wide and writes 7.5 inches. It was improved in a multitude of ways, eventually introducing the bi-chrome function, a two-speed escapement, and other small additions. 
By numbers produced, the Model 3 was the most successful of the Fox upstroke machines, accounting for roughly half of all upstroke production. It was primarily meant for the domestic market.
Early machines will have a quarter-round front bar as found on the models 1 and 2, while later machines have the half-round front bar.









--------- Fox Model 4 ---------

--------- Fox Model 4 ---------

Introduced 1901
Primarily produced from 1901 to 1906
Retail Price New: $105 [8]
Net Weight: 26 ¼ lbs [8]

The Fox Model 4 was introduced in 1901, and is the spiritual successor to the Model 2. It has a keyboard consisting of 44 keys, printing 88 characters, and takes paper 9 inches wide and writes 7.5 inches. Aside from the difference in keyboard sizes, it is nearly identical to the Model 3. It was the primary export machine, as the extra keys were intended for foreign language characters. Domestic machines utilized extra fractions and symbols.
Starting in 1904, the Model 4 could be ordered with a decimal tabulator attached, which required a specialized front bar and extra equipment mounts. The tabulator consists of 10 stopping points, allowing for numbers up to 100,000,000. According to legal records [6], by 1911 only 530 ten-stop tabulators had been manufactured amongst both blind and visible machines. Because of this, those machines with ten-stop tabulators attached are very scarce.
The Fox Model 4 is also known to occupy a special serial number block between 24,000 and 30,000.

		


--------- Fox Model 5 ---------

--------- Fox Model 5 ---------

Introduced 1901
Produced from 1901 to 1906
Retail Price New: $110 [8]
Net Weight: 27 lbs [8]

The Fox Model 5 was introduced in 1901 and is identical to the Model 4 save for the size of the carriage, which takes paper 12 inches wide and writes 9.5 inches. It is a very scarce model, with very few known to still exist.
This model would have likely been used for newspapers, engineering documents, accounting ledgers and records, legal documents, and other assorted work.














--------- Fox Model 6 ---------

Introduced 1901
Produced from 1901 to 1906
Retail Price New: $115 [8]
Net Weight: 27 ¾ lbs [8]

The Fox Model 6 was introduced in 1901 and is identical to the Model 4 save for the size of the carriage, which takes paper 14.5 inches wide and writes 12 inches. It is a very scarce model, with very few known to still exist.
Advertised as useful for insurance offices, railroad offices, and billing alongside other assorted work.
Due to the size of the carriage and the obsolescence of understroke typewriters at the time, it is likely that most of these machines were stripped for parts and material when sold or disposed of. 










--------- Fox Model 7 ---------


Introduced 1901
Produced from 1901 to 1906
Retail Price New: $120 [8]
Net Weight: 29 ¼ lbs [8]

The Fox Model 7 was introduced in 1901 and is identical to the Model 4 save for the size of the carriage, which takes paper 16.5 inches wide and writes 14 inches. It is an incredibly scarce model.
It would have likely been used for newspapers, engineering documents, accounting ledgers and records, legal documents, and other assorted work.
Due to the size of the carriage and the obsolescence of understroke typewriters at the time, it is likely that most of these machines were stripped for parts and material when sold or disposed of.

--------- Fox Model 10 ---------

Unknown introduction year
Unknown production timeline

The Fox Model 10 is a relatively obscure model with a keyboard consisting of 38 keys. Serial numbers range from the mid 1,000’s to the mid 9,000’s. An advertisement in 1911 suggests they were brand new in that year, though this is dubious at best [5].
This model was likely produced from leftover parts or unsold stock, and sold en-masse to the wholesaler mentioned in the advertisement.













--------- Fox Model 15 ---------

--------- Fox Model 15 ---------

Unknown introduction year
Unknown production timeline

The Fox Model 15 is a relatively obscure model. It has a keyboard consisting of 39 keys, and was sold primarily in Europe. It will be noted that the design of the frame is radically different from any other Fox model, and may have been done to lower costs.














--------- Fox Model 16 ---------

Unknown introduction year
Unknown production timeline

The Fox Model 16 is a relatively obscure understroke model with a keyboard consisting of 44 keys. It is listed in a German text [13] as “Model 16 Simplex”. It likely resembles the Model 15 in design and is a minimalist machine meant for sale at a discount rate. It was apparently sold in Germany for 350 marks, a relatively low amount [40].













 
--------- Fox Model 20 ---------

--------- Fox Model 20 ---------

Unknown introduction year
Unknown production timeline

The Model 20 is an obscure visible model which is likely a rebranding by an independent dealer in or beyond the late 1920’s, as crinkle paint did not come about until after Fox met its demise. Its knobs appear to be from the late 1920’s or beyond as well. It has a wide carriage equivalent to the Model 27 or later style Model 28.



















--------- Fox Model 23 ---------

 








Picture courtesy of Richard Polt
--------- Fox Model 23 ---------

Introduced February 1906
Produced from 1906 to 1912

The Fox Model 23 was the first visible machine produced by the company, and was a spiritual successor to the Model 3. It has a keyboard consisting of 39 keys, and utilizes a basket-shift. A notable peculiarity of the machine is its staggered typebars. Early machines lack both the tabulator (introduced by 1908) and back-spacer (introduced 1909).
The machine is notable for keeping the ribbon oscillation feature found on the Model 4, having an almost unbeatable escapement, and an exceptionally light carriage return.
Despite being the launch model for the Fox visible line, the Model 23 was not as successful in the long run as the Model 24, and was phased out in favor of said model in 1912.
Some late Model 23’s were relabeled as The Rapid No. 10 for sale at a discount price.









--------- Fox Model 24 ---------

 
Early Model 24

--------- Fox Model 24 ---------

Introduced 1907
Produced from 1907 to 1922


	The Fox Model 24 was the spiritual successor to the Model 4, with a keyboard consisting of 44 keys. It is nearly identical to the Model 23 save for the larger keyboard and a slightly longer carriage. The Model 24 did not launch with the tabulator, but was equipped with it by the 1,300th machine.
The Model 24 was the primary export machine, with its extra keys utilized for foreign languages. Domestic machines utilized either fractions or special business characters, including those meant for photoplays.
For a time the Model 23 and Model 24 ran concurrently, at first utilizing specific serial number blocks to help organize production. Around the 48,000 mark, the Model 23 ceased production and the Model 24 became the primary manufacturing concern for the company.








--------- Fox Model 24 ---------

 
Late Model 24

--------- Fox Model 24 ---------


In 1912, the Model 24 was given a few minor improvements such as the addition of carriage release levers on both sides of the carriage, and the carriage width was increased to allow 10.5 inch wide paper, writing 8.5 inches. It was also given steel (rather than aluminum) key levers.  Later on, between 1915 and 1919, the black plastic keytops which had been prevalent on all Fox machines since 1898 were replaced with nickel ringed celluloid keytops such as those found on the portable models. These celluloid keytops appear around roughly the 110,000 serial number mark [45]. At an unknown time, the fox head decal was changed out with the one commonly found on the Portable No. 2 and Sterling.
While patents were filed regarding general improvements to the machine to lower the cost of manufacture, the changes never went into effect [30].

--------- Fox Model 25 ---------


 






This machine is in the author’s collection
--------- Fox Model 25 ---------

Introduced 1908
Produced from 1908 to 1915

The Fox Model 25 is identical to the Model 24 save for the size of the carriage, which takes paper 12 inches wide and writes 9.5 inches.
With the introduction of the visible models also came the ability to easily remove the carriage, and so Fox produced separate carriages of varying length for sale. Coupled with the lower demand for wide carriages in the marketplace, it is likely that very few wide-carriage machines were produced overall, and so today this model is relatively scarce. 













--------- Fox Model 26 ---------

--------- The Rapid ---------

Introduced 1912
Unknown production timeline

First appearing in 1912 advertisements, there were two versions of the Rapid typewriter; the Rapid No. 10 which is a relabeled Model 23, and the Rapid No. 24, which is a relabeled Model 24. It is likely that the Rapid name was utilized so as to sell overstocked machines at lower prices.
The Rapid is a very scarce model, and was sold at a discounted price of $75 when first introduced.

--------- Fox Portable No. 1 ---------
 











Picture courtesy of Richard Polt
--------- Fox Portable No. 1 ---------

Introduced November 1917
Produced from 1917 to 1920
Approximately 10,000 produced

Designed by Henry P. Nordmark, and commonly referred to as the “Baby Fox”, the Fox Portable No. 1 was the first attempt at a portable typewriter by the Fox Typewriter Company. It utilized an ingenious folding action which stowed the carriage behind the body of the machine when not in use, and was well engineered. Due to its incredible mechanical design, it boasts an incredibly light touch when compared to similar machines. It also possesses a basket-shift, a feature which would not become common on portable machines until much later.
Similarities between this machine and the Corona 3 Portable Typewriter ensured the beginning of a protracted legal battle between Fox and the Corona Standard Typewriter Company, which sought to defend the power it held in the portable market.
Early machines have a larger backspace key, a paper table decal, a wooden spacebar, and a slightly more archaic ribbon advancement design. Early cases have leather corners and a special pouch for stationary, and have only one latch/lock on the front.





--------- Fox Portable No. 2 ---------

--------- Fox Portable No. 2 ---------

Introduced July 1920
Produced from 1920 to 1921
Approximately 2,000 produced

The Fox Portable No. 2, introduced in 1920, is nearly identical to the Portable No. 1 cosmetically, with the only major difference being new decaling. Mechanically, and alongside some minor improvements, the No. 2 has a brand new escapement design which greatly improves its ability to function. Because of the new design, the back-space key also acts as a margin-release, something which was not present on the No. 1.
Unfortunately for the No. 2, its launch coincided with the main court sessions of the Corona lawsuit. In August, the court issued an injunction to stop all infringement by Fox. Though Fox filed for an appeal and was able to produce machines on bail in the short term, it is highly likely that these legal issues resulted in near immediate creation of the Fox Sterling, a machine which avoided nearly all of the patent issues brought up at trial.







-------- Fox Sterling (Portable No. 3) --------

 








Picture Courtesy of Richard Polt

-------- Fox Sterling (Portable No. 3) --------
Introduced February 1921
Produced from 1921 to 1922
Approximately 1,000 produced

The Fox Sterling (Also designated the No. 3) was introduced around February of 1921 and was designed with a sturdy cast aluminum frame to which the carriage and mechanics attached, no longer utilizing the folding action of its predecessors. This created a slightly more bulky yet still attractive and highly portable machine. It is common opinion that the change from a folding carriage to a stationary design was done in response to the Corona lawsuit.
Mechanically, the Sterling is identical to the Portable No. 2. In a properly serviced condition, the Sterling gives an exceptional typing experience.









Section 3:
Lawsuits and Court Sessions

--- Fox Typewriter Co. Versus J. J. Gorman ---
This was a small case begun in 1904. The Fox Typewriter Company filed suit in the district court at Topeka, Kansas, against their agent there, J. J. Gorman, for the amount of $3,390.89 which Mr. Gorman had attained from sales but failed to remit to the company [36].

----- Gambill versus Fox Typewriter Co. -----
Originally begun on April 7th of 1910 with submission of a complaint, this was a small case involving complications arising from alterations to bonds utilized in a specific contract, and the small but important distinctions between a surety and guarantor in legal terms. Final ruling decided November 7th, 1914 [31].

-- Oehring Et Al. versus Fox Typewriter Co. --
A case brought forth against the company by Mr. Oehring, regarding infringement of a patent Mr. Oehring held which related to a multiple drill. On May the 8th of 1918 the first court ruling decreed that the Fox enterprise owed Mr. Oehring $11,382.95 in reparation, plus additional interest starting from February the 24th of 1917. Oehring decided to pursue a larger sum, and on May 5th of 1921 brought the issue back to court [32].

- Underwood Typewriter Co. versus Fox Typewriter Co.-
	In 1911, A lawsuit was brought forth by the Underwood Typewriter Company against the Fox Typewriter Company in the Sixth Circuit of the Circuit Court of Appeals regarding alleged infringements of the Gathright Patents, No. 436916, for a tabulating attachment for typewriters, and No. 452268, for improvements thereon.
	Underwood argued that the ten-stop and single-button tabulators used on Fox Model 4’s and visible models were an infringement of the design laid out by the mentioned Gathright patents. The court eventually ruled the patents as infringed, but did not rule for restitution as the total monetary profit from the addition of the tabulating attachments was considered at the time insignificant and incalculable. Alongside this, Underwood’s legal representation failed to procure proper evidence that the infringing devices caused financial loss to Underwood [6].

- Corona Typewriter Co. versus Fox Typewriter Co. -
	On July 16th of 1919, the Corona Typewriter Company filed a Bill of Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. A subpoena was issued that very day and was served to the Fox Typewriter Company, requiring it to answer within twenty days. The primary charges were for patent infringement concerning the folding carriage, the escapement mechanism, the ribbon vibrator mechanism, and for the sale of typewriting machines that copied the form and appearance of the Corona 3, namely relating to the frame surrounding the keyboard.
	The primary court session was held during June and July of 1920, and the final hearing took place on August the 2nd and 3rd with a final decision rendered on August 27th. Corona brought forth 8 patents, of which 6 were ruled infringed. The court granted an immediate injunction forbidding Fox from further infringement, and ordered an accounting of the profits derived from infringing machines.

- Fox Typewriter Co. versus Corona Typewriter Co. -
	On December 9th of 1920, Fox appealed to the court to reopen the case in regards to the 6 patents that were found infringed. The appeal was granted, and in the subsequent court case many prior infringements were overturned; the Petermann patent, No. 1064372, was held invalid for want of invention. The Hazen patent, No. 1121094, was held lacking in invention. Hazen patent No. 1121097 was held valid for certain claims, and invalid for others, and overall held infringed for 3 specific claims. The Rose reissue patent No. 13935 was held as insufficient as basis for an injunction against a device not infringing the original patent, and was separately held invalid as double patenting. The Latta reissue patent, No. 14495, was held valid and infringed. The Petermann reissue patent, No. 1459, was held lacking in invention for certain claims, and for others rendered invalid by inclusion of common element [3].

Section 5:
Miscellaneous Facts and TIdbits


•	By February of 1902, the reported output of the Fox factory was 5 machines per day. By June of that same year, production increased to 6 machines per day. It was reported that, if contemplated improvements were to be made, the factory could more than double this rate, possibly hitting 15 machines per day. By 1904, it was being reported that the capacity would soon be increased to 25 machines per day. In 1918, it was stated that improvements could allow production to hit 25 portables and 10 desktops per day.

•	The following statistics are from the Michigan Department of Labor, for 1901, regarding factory operations:

- 10 hour work days
- 59 hour work weeks
- 26 days running on average per month
- 12 months running per year
- The daily wage of a foremen was 		$2.92
- The daily wage of an office worker was 		$2.17
- The daily wage of a standard worker was 	$1.10

•	Total sales for the newly launched enterprise in 1898 amounted to $884.62.

•	According to the Ohio Journal of Commerce, William Fox made arrangements with business men in Dayton, Ohio, so that if $150,000 in stock subscriptions could be secured, the Fox factory would be moved to Dayton.

•	Prior to September 1907, a one to two week shutdown of the factory would occur each year during the summer so that an accounting of inventory could take place.

•	In 1903, the total volume of business for the company exceeded $250,000

•	Machines bought directly from the factory were guaranteed for 3 years.

•	The net earnings for the 14 month period ending September 1st, 1903 were $45,000 [33].

•	According to Bradstreets Book of Commercial Ratings, in 1904 the company had an estimated wealth of $150,000 to $200,000, and was given a credit grade of A.

•	The Michigan Typewriter Exchange was particularly fond of purchasing en-masse the old stock that Fox had on hand. In 1908, it was advertised that they had purchased a lot of 250 leftover Model 3’s for an amount below $50 a machine [38]. It is also notable that they had a large inventory of Model 10’s in 1911, which they described as being “brand new”.

•	In 1907, the company installed a rapid blue-printing apparatus which drew much attention, and was operated solely by electricity and no sunlight [39].
