Collector's Guide to Antique Typewriters. Reprint of The Typewriter Topics Encyclopedia of Typewriters (1923), published by the Post Group. This was long the bible for English-speaking typewriter collectors; it lists all major and most minor typewriters made up to 1923, and describes them in an entertaining if verbose manner. This reprint includes many reproductions of advertisements. Available from Office Machine Americana for $12.95. Also reprinted by Dover, edited by Victor Linoff (see below).
Current, Richard N. The Typewriter and the Men Who Made It. Reprint by the Post Group of a 1950s study of the invention of the Sholes & Glidden. Good reading. Available from Office Machine Americana for $17.95.
Dale, Rodney and Rebecca Weaver. Machines in the Office. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. A short, popular book that covers typewriters, telegraphs, telephones, dictation machines, computers, and more. Gives you a sense of the context in which typewriters were invented. Entertaining, and includes many good illustrations. Information on typewriters is not very reliable, though.
James, Duncan. Old Typewriters. London: Shire Publications, 1993. Shire Album #293. $7.25. A small pamphlet that attractively presents the essentials of typewriter mechanisms and has some nice black-and-white photographs.
Linoff, Victor (ed). The Typewriter: An Illustrated History. New York: Dover Publications, 2000. A reprint of the 1923 Typewriter Topics Encyclopedia of Typewriters. An important early source that includes lots of usually-reliable data. The same book is available in a smaller format with reproductions of early advertisements, under the name Collector's Guide to Antique Typewriters (see above).
Mares, G.C. History of the Typewriter, Successor to the Pen. London: Guilbert Pitman, 1909. Reprinted by the Post Group. An excellent early "buyer's guide" to writing machines. Available from Office Machine Americana for $24.95.

Morton, Jett. The Oliver Typewriter Company: Machines and History. 2011. $19.95 at Lulu.com. A very clear and informative rundown of Oliver history and models, well-known and obscure, American and British. Everyone who owns an Oliver ought to have this book.
Mullaney, Thomas S. The Chinese Typewriter: A History. MIT Press, 2017. A close look at Chinese typewriters reveals interesting facts about the machines, the Chinese language, its script, and ergonomics.
Polt, Richard. The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist's Companion for the 21st Century.  Countryman Press, 2015. My book, unlike the others in this list, is not primarily a history, but a report on the contemporary typewriter renaissance and a how-to guide for those wishing to use a typewriter.
Robert, Paul. Sexy Legs and Typewriters. Virtual Typewriter Museum, 2004. "Women in office-related advertising, humor, glamour, and erotica." A different sort of book, not for those who disapprove of "R"-rated material. Follow the link to order the book.

Russo, Thomas. Mechanical Typewriters: Their History, Value, and Legacy. Schiffer Publishing, 2002. Written by a former Remington man who has a fabulous collection and museum. Not the best in terms of completeness or accuracy, but notable for fine photographs of Russo's machines, including some very unusual items. A separate chapter on Remingtons is probably the most complete account of that make in print. Value estimates are reasonable. By the same author: Office Collectibles: 100 Years of Business Technology. Both books are also available directly from the author: Russo & Associates, LLC, 1200 Philadelphia Pike, Suite 220, Wilmington, DE 19809, USA.

Books out of print

A good place to search for used books online is Bookfinder. Or ask your friendly local librarian to get these on interlibrary loan. 
Adler, Michael H. The Writing Machine. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1973. A scrupulously researched book that features a very thorough investigation of the early history of typewriter invention, and a long list of "unconventional" typewriters. This is a keeper.
Adler, Michael. Antique Typewriters, from Creed to QWERTY. Schiffer Publishing, 1997. $39.95. An exploration of early typewriters by the author of the classic The Writing Machine (see above). 208 pages with lots of color and black-and-white photos. Written in an entertaining tone with a sense of humor. Lots of information, but occasionally errors creep in. Includes price suggestions which are generally reliable, sometimes on the high side. This book is the most comprehensive typewriter history in English. I recommend it for any serious collector.
Beeching, Wilfred A. Century of the Typewriter. London: Heinemann, 1974. Information in this book is unreliable but plentiful. Useful lists of serial numbers, and an excellent selection of photographs. A paperback reprint was produced in the 1990s, and can probably be found more easily than the original. In the UK, reprints may be available from Bernard Williams, 80 Manor Road, Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, DE 159 9SP.
Bliven, Bruce, Jr. The Wonderful Writing Machine. New York: Random House, 1954. An entertaining, journalistic book sponsored by Royal (so, as you'd expect, the Royal typewriter is presented as the greatest thing since sliced bread). This book can often be found at used bookshops.
Herrl, George. Catalog of the Carl P. Dietz Collection of Typewriters. Milwaukee: Milwaukee Public Museum, 1965. A nice set of photographs (some are reprinted in Beeching). Information is sometimes unreliable.
Lippman, Paul. American Typewriters: A Collector's Encyclopedia. Hoboken, N.J.: Original & Copy, 1992. A self-published hardback book by a longtime collector -- includes many illustrations and personal observations about virtually all American-made typewriters, plus useful information and advice for the collector.
Martin, Ernst (pseudonym of Johannes Meyer). Die Schreibmaschine und ihre Entwicklungsgeschichte. 4th ed: Pappenheim, Bavaria, 1949. An outstanding, encyclopedic work. Plentiful illustrations make it worth looking at even if you don't know a word of German. 
Masi, Frank (ed.). The Typewriter Legend. Secaucus, N.J.: Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, 1985. This book put out by Matsushita when they were introducing the short-lived Panasonic electronic typewriter is very good: generally accurate, entertaining, and sporting a large number of interesting black-and-white photos. The author was actually collector Don Sutherland. Hard to find, but worth looking for.
Rehr, Darryl. Antique Typewriters & Office Collectibles. Collector Books, 1997. $19.95. This book by the former editor of the journal of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association is an invaluable guide, including detailed descriptions of hundreds of typewriters, illustrated with color photos. It is not exhaustive, and the estimates of value are generally agreed to be too low, but this is a very good first book for the beginning typewriter collector .
