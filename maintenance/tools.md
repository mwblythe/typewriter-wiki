# Spring Hooks
These tools make working with tiny springs easier -- hooking and unhooking. There are many styles.

[IBM Style Hook](http://r.ebay.com/d7Zhlx)

On this type, the non-hooked end is very useful for pushing springs and a lot more. That eBay link is not the last word in that style of hook, so look around. Even check Amazon. Multi-packs can be notably cheaper per hook.

[Captive Hook](https://www.specialized.net/jonard-m-145-6-5-captive-pull-spring-hook.html)

That one has a little hook inside the hook that is spring loaded and will reach out, grab and hold onto your spring (or HINT: carriage return cord).

# Screw Starters
Screw-starter tools are exceptionally handy. This is a very useful type:

This next style is not as helpful for normal use, but every once in a while you do have those large slotted screws that the smaller brass style cannot handle:
