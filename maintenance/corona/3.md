# Ribbon
The ribbon should be 7 yards long and 1/2" wide. Longer ribbons can cause mechanical issues. It should feed from the rear of the right spool and the front of the left spool because both spools draw the ribbon in a clockwise direction. The Spool Nut should only be tight on one spool or the other (one loose and the other tight) or the machine will freeze up.

# Removing Platen
1. Loosen or remove platen set screws
2. Loosen or remove platen knob set screw
3. Push or gently tap right end of shaft until you can grip the left end and pull it out
4. Lift right end of platen up and towards you, being carful to work it free of the margin release lever
