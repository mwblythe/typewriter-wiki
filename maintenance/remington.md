# Removing Platen
1. Remove screw in the end of right-hand knob
2. Pull off knob
3. Hold carriage lock lever to unblock hole in left end of platen
4. Still holding lever, push rod from right end, through platen, and out the left end. You may have to gently tap the rod from the right end to get it to slide through. Use a hammer, but gently. If the rod has entered the hole already, use a nail (head first) or small metal rod to tap it through.
5. Remove the guide behind the ribbon vibrator to give more clearance for removing platen. Simply loosen the two screws and lift the guide up and out. Tighten the screws again to make sure they do not fall out.
6. Lift up on the right end of the platen, slide it slightly to the right to disengage from the left side, then up and out
