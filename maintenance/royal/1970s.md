## Shift (Vertical) Adjustment

On the right end of the carriage, in front of the rails, there are two screws. The outer screw is for lowercase, and the inner screw is for uppercase. The left side of the carriage has only the lowercase screw for some reason. You may need to adjust both for lowercase tuning.
