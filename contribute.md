# Wiki Syntax
This wiki uses a simple markup language called Markdown. It was designed to be simpler than full HTML and as close to "plain text" as possible. (You can also mix in straight HTML in case you want to do something more advanced.)

Here's some light reading to get you going:

* [Wiki.js reference](https://docs.requarks.io/wiki/user-guide/markdown-syntax) official reference for this wiki software (incomplete)
* [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a 3rd party Markdown reference
* [Official specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
